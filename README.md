Please note that not all audio clips have been modified since ffmpeg is unable to handle .wav files with incorrect dates. However, this issue primarily affects voice acting clips. If you are able to resolve this issue or create a superior version of this, please open a pull request. If you have fixed the files yourself, please submit a pull request with the modifications you made.
